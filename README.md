<h1 align="center"> 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 "Inheritance" 🧬</h1>

This program demonstrates several uses of C++ inheritance through an example ticket price calculator. 

The program uses inheritance to define several different kinds of tickets: an "Advance Ticket", "Student Advance Ticket" and "Walk Up Ticket". These tickets each have their own methods and make use of OOP features such as const functions and protected members.
